## TetraStation Codebase

* **Website:** https://tetra.furryhelix.co.uk
* **Code:** https://github.com/TamberP/TetraStation
* **Code (Mirror)**: https://git.furryhelix.co.uk/tetrastation
* **Wiki:** https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Main_Page is a good place to start for the basics, but the codebases have diverged quite a way now, and the differences will only continue to increase.
* **Codedocs:** https://codedocs.tgstation13.org/

This is the codebase for TetraStation, a fork of the /tg/station flavour of SpaceStation 13.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!
