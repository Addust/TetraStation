## TetraStation Codebase

* **Website:** https://tetra.furryhelix.co.uk
* **Code:** https://github.com/TetraStation/TetraStation
* **Wiki:** https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Main_Page is a good place to
  start for the basics, but the codebases have diverged quite a way
  now, and the differences will only continue to increase.
  I will put up a wiki eventually, I promise.
* **Codedocs:** https://codedocs.tgstation13.org/
  Though this will also have diverged by now.

This is the codebase for TetraStation, a distressingly "Thanksgiving
at your Grandparents'"-themed fork of the /tg/station flavour of
SpaceStation 13.

At least, if Thanksgiving at your grandparents involved fire,
explosions, murder, the cold vacuum of space, and cops beating
everyone in sight.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set
against the backdrop of a nonsensical, plastic and metal death-trap
masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to
represent the "old and worn out" sci-fi setting and its dangerous
undertones. Have fun, and survive!

"My god, it's even more rickety and rusty than my last posting..."

"CMO to Bridge; All the drugs have broken down from age and exposure."

"Bridge to CMO; ...exposure to what?"

"CMO to Bridge; The crew, mostly."

"Bridge to CMO; ...That's fair. I also have breakdowns when I'm
exposed to the crew for too long."
